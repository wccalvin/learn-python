Regular Expressions
-------------------

Introduction:
1) Really clever "wild card" expressions for matching and parsing strings.
2) A language of "marker characters" -- like $, ^

Regular Expression Quick Guide:

^           -> Matches the beginning of a line
$           -> Matches the end of the line
.           -> Matches any character
\s          -> Matches whitespace
\S          -> Matches any non-whitespace character
*           -> Repeats a character zero or more times
*?          -> Repeats a character zero or more times (non-greedy)
+           -> Repeats a character one or more times
+?          -> Repeats a character one or more times (non-greedy)
[aeiou]     -> Matches a single character in the listed set
[^XYZ]      -> Matches a single character not in the listed set
[a-z0-9]    -> The set of characters can include a range
(           -> Indicates where string extraction is to start
)           -> Indicates where string extraction is to end

Python Specifics:

import re  # imports the regex module for python
re.search()  # use to see if a string matches a regular expression
re.findall()  # use to extract portions of a string that matches a regular expression
