# Lambda Expressions

Lambda expressions allows us to create "anonymous" functions. This means we
can quickly create ad-hoc functions without properly defining a function
using def.

Lambda is less general than a properly defined def statement. It is limited
to a simple expression than a block of statements.

Lambda is designed for coding simple functions.
